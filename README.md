# PriceArt ADA NFT-sites

This Repo contains the source code for an individual NFT site hosted on IPFS. Each PriceArt NFT comes with a fully interactive custom website in the metadata of the NFT. Turns out, its fairly simple to host a small collection of web files on IPFS, so I wanted to give each NFT holder access to their own site.

For more info, view the ADA PriceArt explorer repo.
